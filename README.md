# image-recognition
 This project is a simple image recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. It utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
**### Image Recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
This project demonstrates the implementation of an image recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The system is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. It can classify images into one of the following categories: Plane, Car, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, or Truck.

**Features**

- Data Preprocessing: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded and preprocessed, including normalization of pixel values.
- Model Architecture: A CNN architecture is defined using TensorFlow and Keras, comprising convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
- Model Training: The model is trained on a subset of the CIFAR-10 dataset with specified epochs.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on a separate test dataset to measure accuracy and loss.
- Model Saving and Loading: The trained model is saved in the native Keras format for future use and loaded when required.
- Image Recognition: Custom images can be provided for recognition, with the model predicting the corresponding class label.


**Requirements**

1. Python 3.x
2. TensorFlow
3. Keras
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. OpenCV (cv2)
